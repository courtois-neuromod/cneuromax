# Packages required to run any component of the CNeuroML library

#############################
# Package full name: Submitit
# Quickstart link: https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit#submit-it
# Note: Submitit with configurable Python path when running on Slurm
#       (ex: for use with Podman/Apptainer)
# Remark: This change is currently waiting as a PR:
#         https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit/pull/1729
#         However, based on the lack of recent GitHub activity, it looks like
#         this will not be integrated anytime soon and we will need to install
#         Submitit through our own fork (in case the branch that created the
#         PR gets deleted) for the foreseable future. This repository
#         automatically synchronizes with the main one through a GitHub Action
#         workflow to keep it up to date.

##########################
# Package full name: Hydra
# Quickstart link: https://hydra.cc/docs/intro
# Note: Hydra with integration of above updated Submitit package
# Remark: Based on the lack of recent GitHub activity, it looks like we will
#         also need to install Hydra this way for the foreseable future.
#         This repository also automatically synchronizes with the main one.
