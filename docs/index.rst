CNeuroMax is a machine learning tool being developed in the context of the
`Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling <https://www.cneuromod.ca/>`_, also
known as the Courtois NeuroMod / CNeuroMod project. Launched in 2018, the
project aims to create more human-like AI models by training them to emulate
both human brain dynamics and behaviour. Phase I (2018-2023) of the
project saw large-scale data acquisition and preliminary unimodal modelling.
Phase II (2023-2027) of the project aims to create multimodal phantom models
of the subjects.

CNeuroMax was created to bridge the technical knowledge acquired by CNeuroMod
researchers during their Phase I experiments.
